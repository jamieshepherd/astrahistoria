  "name": "13th Black Crusade",
  "summary": "Warmaster Abaddon launches the 13th Black Crusade. The armies of Chaos Undivided lay siege primarily to Cadia but attack many of the surrounding worlds as well. Imperial Forces launch a massive counterattack, and eventually push back the tides of Chaos, but only just barely, and at great cost. The Space Wolves' 13th Great Company are amongst the forces seen fighting against the forces of chaos. Major side battles include the Diamor Campaign."
